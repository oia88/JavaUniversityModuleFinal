# JavaUniversityModuleFinal

I want to make a system to track my university classes, teachers and students. Each Teacher has a name, and
a salary calculated by the following rules:
● For the full time teachers: base salary (attribute) multiplied by 110% of its experience years.
● For part time teachers: base salary multiplied for its active hours per week.
The university includes a list of teachers, a list of students and a list of classes. Each class has a name, an
assigned classroom, a list of students and a teacher. Every student has his name, id, and age.
The program should:
1. Initialize minimum 2 different teachers of each type (full time, part time).
2. Initialize minimum 6 different students
3. Initialize minimum 4 different classes including its teacher , students and other relevant data
4. Print a menú including the following options:
a. Print all the professors with its data
b. Print all the classes and a submenu to select a class in order to print the class data including its
teacher and students
c. Create a new student and add it to an existing class
d. Create a new class and add an existing teacher, existing students and its relevant data
e. List all the classes in which a given student is included (hint: search by id)
f. Exit
Rules:
- The project must be uploaded to a new public github repository, which should be public. The repository
should include appropriate use of .gitIgnore, more than one branch, and multiple commits.
- The project repository link must be sent to the Java mentors (Felipe, Juan Pablo) before the due date.
The link must be specified on the following document: The Final project repo project is due on
Monday October 31, 11:59PM.
- The project should include at least:
● Design Diagram (Any format you want, UML recommended, may be any standard format, even
a cellphone photo)
● Access modifiers
● Encapsulation
● Inheritance
● Polymorphism
● Constructors
● Static attributes/methods
● Main class
● Packages and layers with proper naming
● Reading and printing (it’s not necessary to do it from console, should not be on the data model)
